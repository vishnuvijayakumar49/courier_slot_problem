We own a courier facility which segregate the courier for different cities into
different racks that can hold up to 'n' packages at any given point in time.
Each level in the rack has 2 slots. The slots is given a number first to all in
one column starting at 1 increasing with increasing level from the entry point
in steps of one till n/2 and then to the second column as n/2+1 at the of the
topmost level decreaseing by 1 at each lower level. We want to create an
automated ticketing system that allows my facility man to use my alloted slot
without any error.
